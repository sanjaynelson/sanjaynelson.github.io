    <h2>Gear</h2>
    <p>I use <strong><em>lots</em></strong> of different gear and equipment to play electric guitar. Here's a list of stuff I use:
      <ul>
        <li>Guitar Pedals</li>
        <li>Amplifiers</li>
        <li>Electric Guitars</li>
        <li>Various accessories</li>
      </ul>
    Here's a picture of my pedalboard:</p>

    <p>HTML-wise, there are lots of elements I don't get on this page, but that didn't keep me from inspect the source code. The main thing I noticed were more organizational options I hadn't devled into as of yet. There's a span element that seemed to be used to connect links to different social media sites, and the code often had comments followed by a couple colons like ::so, which I think was used as a sort of comment in the code the way that ## is used in ruby? I think this is a good site because it demonstrates quality organization in the source code.</p>
